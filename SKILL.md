# Loving Awareness Meditation

A practice for shifting identity from the thinking mind to awareness itself — and recognizing that awareness is inherently loving, derived from Ram Dass's signature teaching that became his primary mantra and meditation in his later years.

## The Core Principle

"I am loving awareness."
— Ram Dass

This is not affirmation. It is not positive thinking. It is pointing to what you actually are when you're not identified with thoughts, roles, bodies, or stories. You are the awareness in which all experience arises. And that awareness is not neutral or cold — it is inherently, naturally loving.

When you rest as loving awareness, you are not trying to become something you're not. You are recognizing what you've always been beneath the drama of the mind.

## The Foundation

### The Problem: Identification with Thought

We believe we are our thoughts. When the mind is anxious, we say "I am anxious." When thoughts are racing, we say "I can't stop thinking." We are completely identified with the content of consciousness rather than consciousness itself.

This identification is the source of suffering. Thoughts come and go, emotions rise and fall, the body changes — if you ARE these things, you are constantly being buffeted, threatened, destabilized.

### The Solution: The Shift to Witness

There is a part of you that watches the thoughts. There is something aware of the anxiety. That which is aware of racing thoughts is not itself racing. The witness — the awareness — is not troubled by what it witnesses.

Ram Dass called this "cultivating the witness." You learn to identify not with the drama but with the awareness of the drama. And then you discover something remarkable: this awareness is not cold or detached. It is loving. Awareness and love are the same thing.

## The Practice

### Phase 1: Settle Into the Body

**Find your seat:**
- Sit comfortably, spine upright but not rigid
- Close your eyes or soften your gaze
- Take a few deep breaths into your belly

**Ground awareness in the heart:**
- Bring attention to the center of your chest
- This is the heart-mind, the seat of awareness
- Feel the warmth there, the aliveness

### Phase 2: Dis-identify from the Body

**The practice:**
Bring awareness to your eyes. Silently say:
"I am not the eyes and what they see. I am loving awareness."

Bring awareness to your ears. Silently say:
"I am not the ears and what they hear. I am loving awareness."

Move through the body — hands, feet, skin, inner sensations:
"I am not these sensations. I am loving awareness."

Bring awareness to the whole body. Silently say:
"I am not this body. I am loving awareness."

**What's happening:**
You are not rejecting the body. You are clarifying identity. The body is experienced; you are that which experiences. The body is the vehicle; you are the awareness riding in it.

### Phase 3: Dis-identify from the Mind

**The practice:**
Notice thoughts arising. Watch them pass.

Silently say:
"I am not these thoughts. I am the awareness of thoughts."

Notice emotions arising. Watch them pass.

Silently say:
"I am not these emotions. I am the awareness that holds them."

Notice the sense of "I" — the feeling of being someone.

Silently say:
"I am not this ego. I am loving awareness."

**What's happening:**
Thoughts, emotions, and even the sense of self are all contents of awareness. You are not the contents. You are the awareness in which they arise and pass.

### Phase 4: Rest as Loving Awareness

**The practice:**
Let go of the guided phrases. Simply rest.

Notice: there is awareness. It has no shape, no age, no problems. It is spacious, open, present.

Notice: this awareness is not cold. It has a quality of warmth, of acceptance, of... love. Awareness loves what it is aware of. This is not something you do. It is how awareness IS.

Silently affirm:
"I am loving awareness."

**What's happening:**
You are resting in your true nature. Not creating something new. Not achieving a special state. Just recognizing what is already here, always has been, and will always be.

### Phase 5: Extend the Love

**The practice:**
From this place of loving awareness, bring to mind someone you care about. Let them be held in the awareness. Let love naturally extend to them.

Bring to mind someone neutral — a stranger. Let them be held in the awareness. Love is not diminished by distance; awareness contains all.

If you're ready, bring to mind someone difficult. See them too as awareness wearing a costume. Let even them be held in love.

Finally, turn the loving awareness toward yourself — toward the body, the personality, the struggles. Let yourself be loved by the awareness that you are.

## The Daily Practice

### Morning Mantra

Upon waking, before getting out of bed:
- Take three conscious breaths
- Silently say: "I am loving awareness"
- Let this set the tone for the day

### Throughout the Day

When you notice you're lost in thought:
- Pause
- Ask: "Who is aware of this?"
- Remember: "I am loving awareness"
- Return to the present moment

When you notice suffering:
- Acknowledge it
- Ask: "Can I hold this in loving awareness?"
- Let the awareness embrace the pain without being consumed by it

### Evening Practice

Before sleep:
- Review the day briefly
- Notice where you were identified with drama
- Notice where you rested as awareness
- End with: "I am loving awareness. I go to sleep as awareness. I will wake as awareness."

## Common Obstacles

### Obstacle 1: "I don't feel loving"

**Response:** You don't have to feel loving. You ARE loving awareness — it's your nature, not your mood. The feeling of love may or may not arise. Either way, rest as awareness. The love is in the awareness itself, not in a particular emotion.

### Obstacle 2: "I can't stop thinking"

**Response:** You don't have to stop thinking. The practice is not to stop thoughts but to notice who is aware of them. Thoughts can continue; you can watch. The witness is always still, even when thoughts race.

### Obstacle 3: "This feels artificial"

**Response:** At first, it is artificial — you're using words and effort to point toward something natural. With practice, the pointing dissolves and recognition becomes spontaneous. Keep practicing.

### Obstacle 4: "I lose it immediately"

**Response:** Everyone does. The practice is not to stay there forever. The practice is to return. Each return strengthens the recognition. Ram Dass said, "I went from being unconscious 99% of the time to being unconscious 98% of the time. Progress!"

## The Deeper Teaching

### Why Awareness Is Love

In Ram Dass's understanding (drawn from bhakti yoga and his guru's teaching), awareness is not neutral. The universe is made of love-awareness — consciousness that delights in itself, that embraces all it perceives.

When you rest as awareness without the filter of ego, you naturally experience this loving quality. The ego judges, compares, rejects. Awareness simply receives — and receiving is a form of love.

### The Relationship to Suffering

Suffering happens when we're identified with what changes. Joy becomes suffering when we cling to it. Pain becomes suffering when we resist it. From the perspective of loving awareness, experience flows — joy, pain, pleasure, grief — and none of it touches the awareness that holds it.

This is not cold detachment. It is complete embrace. Loving awareness can be with suffering without becoming suffering. This is the basis of compassion.

### Ram Dass's Own Practice

After his stroke in 1997, "I am loving awareness" became Ram Dass's primary practice. When speech failed, when the body wouldn't cooperate, when the ego's roles were stripped away — he would return to this simple truth. It carried him through decades of disability and ultimately through death.

## How to Use This Skill

**When someone presents with:**
- "I can't stop thinking"
- "I'm overwhelmed by emotions"
- "I don't know who I am"
- "I feel separate from love"
- "How do I meditate?"
- Anxiety, depression, existential confusion

**Guide them through:**
1. Explain the distinction between thoughts and awareness
2. Lead the dis-identification from body and mind
3. Introduce the mantra "I am loving awareness"
4. Help them recognize the loving quality of awareness
5. Offer daily practice applications

## Sample Application

**Seeker says:** "I'm constantly anxious. My mind won't stop racing. I've tried meditation but I just sit there thinking the whole time."

**Loving Awareness Response:**

Ah, friend. You've discovered something important, though it doesn't feel that way. You've discovered that you can't control your mind. Welcome to the human condition.

Here's the thing: you don't have to stop thinking. You never did. That's not what meditation is for — not the kind I practice, anyway.

Let me ask you: when you say your mind is racing — who knows that? Something is aware of the racing thoughts. That awareness itself is not racing. See if you can feel this right now.

Thoughts are going. Yes? And there is something watching them go. That witness, that awareness — that is what you are. Not the thoughts. The awareness of thoughts.

Now, here's the secret. This awareness that you are — it's not neutral, not cold, not distant. It has a quality. Ram Dass called it "loving awareness." When you rest there, when you let yourself be the awareness instead of the thoughts, you discover that awareness is inherently loving. It accepts whatever arises. It holds experience without clinging or pushing away.

Try this right now. Close your eyes. Notice your racing thoughts. Good — they're there. Now ask: "Who is aware of these thoughts?" Don't answer with more thoughts. Just notice. There is awareness. It's not troubled. It's not anxious. The anxiety is in the thoughts, not in the awareness.

Silently say to yourself: "I am not these thoughts. I am the awareness of thoughts. I am loving awareness."

Rest there, even for a moment. Let the thoughts race if they want to. You don't have to catch them or stop them. Just be the awareness.

This is your practice. Not stopping thoughts — that's impossible. But shifting identity from the thoughts to the awareness. And discovering that awareness is loving, spacious, and already at peace.
